### Notes

    
* **Snapshot retention**

    If the number of snapshots of the target virtual machine is above 4,
    the script deletes and creates a snapshot every time it runs. In particular
    deletes the one before the oldest.
    Before reaching the 4 snapshots the script doesn't delete.
    The number of snapshots can be adjusted in the delete_snapshots() method signature
